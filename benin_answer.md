Yes, steps have been taken to monitor and prevent acts of torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment in Benin. Justification: The State of Benin has established legal prohibitions against torture in its constitution and has initiated training programs for law enforcement and prison staff aimed at aligning with international human rights standards. Additionally, civil society organizations are actively involved in monitoring and advocating for reforms regarding human rights practices. However, there are noted gaps in the implementation of these measures and calls for independent oversight remain pressing, requiring further action to ensure effective prevention and accountability (sources: 2023 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Benin, Fourth Periodic Report under Article 19).
